**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://promise.solutions/discord) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the Countr codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process.
